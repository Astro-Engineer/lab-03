## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: REST APIs are easy to scale ecause there is a separation between the client and server. Since the client must include all information 
for the server to fulfill a request. This means that the server doesn't have to maintain or update the session. 

Answer for Question 2: The resources that the mail server is providing is the sender, reciever, message body, and subject. 

Answer for Question 3: The most common REST method not used is PUT, which updates existing data on a server. The mail server could implement a put function to update the content of existing mail, as the code currently has no update functionality.

Answer for Question 4: API Keys are useful for REST API authentication, by generating a unique key for each API client, allowing for user authentication. It essentially acts as a "password" of source.
